gpu-alert is a Python application that sends email alerts when retailers receive stock. Originally used to find GPU stock availability during the 2020-21 shortage.

Popular stock alert services send emails too slowly to secure an SKU. Self-hosting gpu-alert gives a guaranteed alert on time.

Made using Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) and BeautifulSoup4.
